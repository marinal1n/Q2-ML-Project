Loan approval prediction is a critical task in financial systems as it directly impacts individuals’ access to resources and institutions’ risk management. These problems tend to be heterogeneous, skewed and contain challenging mixed-type datasets, which combine numerical and categorical variables. In this paper, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Voting K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm, which processes both numerical and nominal features for more accurate loan prediction. By experimenting with Euclidean and Mahalanobis distance strategies for numerical features and dissimilarity measures for categorical features, we discover novel correlations that allow more accurate prediction in complex datasets. Traditional algorithms tested on uniform datasets often fail to generalize to complex datasets with imbalanced class distributions. Our mixed data KNN algorithm incorporates Mahalanobis distance and weighted majority voting to overcome limitations in skewed class datasets. Experimental evaluations on robust loan datasets demonstrated an accuracy of 88.94%, a significant improvement performance of 2.66% compared to the conventional baselines, highlighting the efficacy of our novel algorithm in real-world applications.
